    <h2>Description</h3>

            <p>Buldak noodles are a fiery Korean instant noodle dish known for their intense heat and bold, savory flavor. The chewy noodles are coated in a thick, spicy sauce made from gochujang, chili, soy, and a hint of sweetness, creating a rich, smoky heat that builds with each bite. Often finished with toasted sesame seeds and bits of roasted seaweed, buldak noodles deliver a satisfying balance of spice, umami, and texture that has made them a favorite among chili lovers worldwide.</p>
